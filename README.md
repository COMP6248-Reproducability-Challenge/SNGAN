# SPECTRAL NORMALIZATION FOR GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS

This repository is mainly for reproduce a paper : [SPECTRAL NORMALIZATION FOR GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05957)<br>
We compare the difference between SNGAN and some other versions of gan, such as WGAN-GP,BEGAN,EBGAN and DCGAN based on BN and LN.<br>
These codes are evaluated with the inception score and Fr√©chet Inception Distance on Cifar-10 dataset.<br>
