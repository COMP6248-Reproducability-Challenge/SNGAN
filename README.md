# SPECTRAL NORMALIZATION FOR GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS

This repository is mainly for reproduce a paper : [SPECTRAL NORMALIZATION FOR GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05957)

Compare the difference between SNGAN and some other versions of gan, such as WGAN-GP,BEGAN,EBGAN and DCGAN based on BN and LN.

These codes are evaluated with the inception score and Fr√©chet Inception Distance on Cifar-10 dataset.
